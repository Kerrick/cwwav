What and why
============

This program takes one or more text files (or text read from standard
input) and converts it into a WAV (audio) file containing CW (Morse
code).

It's useful for generating practice files if you are learning CW and
want to practice by listening to text on your iPod, phone, laptop or
whatever.

It's a very simple program but it is designed to do what it does
well. That is, it is designed to produce good sounding CW output
files, with proper timing and comfortable envelope to avoid keyclicks
and make the CW softer.

This is a VERY EARLY alpha release, there are still many more features
to be added such as better mapping for some characters and prosigns.

But it does generate nice practice fiels!


Installation
============

Make sure you have libsndfile-dev installed. On Ubuntu this is easy:

  $ sudo apt-get install libsndfile-dev

Then compile the program:

  $ make

If that works out, you can run it directly from the current directory, or
install it system-wide by doing:

  $ sudo make install


How to use
==========

Usage: cwwav OPTIONS [FILENAME...]
Convert text into a WAV file with morse code.

Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
  -s, --stereo       generate stereo output (two identical channels)
  -o, --output       specify output file (must be supplied)
  -f, --frequency=N  use sidetone frequency N Hz (default: 750)
  -r, --rate=N       sample rate N (default 44100)
  -w, --wpm=N        use N words per minute (default: 25)
  -e, --envelope=N   envelope N ms at start/end of each tone (default=10)
  -h, --help         display this help and exit

Example
=======

I took the "printable" version of the James Clerk Maxwell article on
Wikipedia and covnerted into text (examples/maxwell.txt).

Then I converted it to a 20-WPM CW file like this:

 $ ./cwwav --output maxwell.wav --frequency=650 --rate=16000 --wpm=20 examples/maxwell.txt

Then I converted the resulting WAV file into an MP3 file using lame:

 $ lame --preset phone maxwell.wav maxwell.mp3

Finally I deleted the intermediate maxwell.wav file and copied the
resulting maxwell.mp3 file to my phone.

I hope you enjoy this program and find it useful for generating
practice files. Any commends, suggestions etc. are very welcome, my
